### **Objective**

The capstone project aims to create a data platform that efficiently handles data ingestion, storage, processing, and analytics. Students are tasked with designing a scalable architecture that supports business intelligence and decision-making processes.

### **Data Engineering Methodology**

The project involves several critical components typical in data engineering workflows:

- **Data Ingestion:**
    - Collect data from various sources such as web servers and customer interactions.
    - Use Apache Airflow for orchestrating complex data pipelines.

- **Data Storage:**
    - Utilize MySQL for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases to handle transactional data.
    - Implement MongoDB for NoSQL database needs, storing catalog data.
    - Use PostgreSQL for staging data warehouses, preparing data for further processing.

- **Data Processing:**
    - Leverage Apache Spark for big data analytics, enabling large-scale data processing and transformation.
    - Use Hadoop as a big data platform for distributed storage and processing.

- **Data Warehousing:**
    - Employ IBM Db2 on Cloud as the production data warehouse, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of processed data.

- **Business Intelligence:**
    - Integrate IBM Cognos Analytics to provide business intelligence dashboards and reporting capabilities.

### **Tools and Technologies**

- **Databases:**
    - MySQL for transactional data.
    - MongoDB for NoSQL storage.
    - PostgreSQL for staging.
    - IBM Db2 on Cloud for production warehousing.

- **Big Data Platforms:**
    - Hadoop for distributed processing.
    - Apache Spark for analytics.

- **Data Pipeline Orchestration:**
    - Apache Airflow for managing workflows.

- **Business Intelligence:**
    - IBM Cognos Analytics for insights and reporting.

### **Outcome**

By completing this capstone project, students gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing a robust data platform architecture. They learn how to manage complex data workflows efficiently, ensuring high-quality, accessible data ready for analysis. This project enhances their ability to solve real-world data engineering challenges, preparing them for roles such as Data Engineer or Database Architect.

The capstone provides a significant addition to their professional portfolio, showcasing their ability to build scalable and efficient data solutions. It emphasizes critical thinking in architecture design and effective communication of technical results to stakeholders, equipping students with the skills needed to excel in advanced positions within the field of data engineering.

In this Capstone project, you will: "Design and build" a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. "Design and build" a data warehouse and generate reports from the data. "Design and build" a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. Extract data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline. And finally, create an Apache Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a Machine Learning model (SparkML).

1. In [Module_1](Capstone%20Project%20Files/1_MySQL_OLTP_DB_Transactional_Data), you will design the OLTP database for an E-Commerce website, populate the OLTP Database with the data provided and automate the export of the daily incremental data into the data warehouse. 

2. In [Module_2](Capstone%20Project%20Files/2_MongoDB_NoSQL_Database_Catalog_Data), you will set up a NoSQL database to store the catalog data for an E-Commerce website, load the E-Commerce catalog data into the NoSQL database, and query the E-Commerce catalog data in the NoSQL database. 

3. In [Module_3-a](Capstone%20Project%20Files/3-a%20_PostgreSQL_Staging_Data_Warehouse), you will design the schema for a data warehouse based on the schema of the OLTP and NoSQL databases. While on [Module_3-b](Capstone%20Project%20Files/3-b_Db2_Production_Data_Warehouse), youâ€™ll then create the schema and load the data into fact and dimension tables, automate the daily incremental data insertion into the data warehouse, and create Cubes and Rollups to make the reporting easier. 

4. In [Module_4](Capstone%20Project%20Files/4_Cognos_Analytics_Business_Intelligence), you will create a Cognos (Business Intelligence Analytics) data source that points to a data warehouse table, create a bar chart of Quarterly sales of cell phones, create a pie chart of sales of electronic goods by category, and create a line chart of total sales per month for the year 2020. 

5. In [Module_5](Capstone%20Project%20Files/5_ETL_and_Data_Pipelines), you will extract data from OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases into CSV format. You will then transform the OLTP data to suit the data warehouse schema and then load the transformed data into the data warehouse. Finally, you will verify that the data is loaded properly. 

6. In [Module_6](Capstone%20Project%20Files/6_Spark_BigData_Cluster), you will use your skills in Big Data Analytics to create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model on SparkML for making sales projections.
