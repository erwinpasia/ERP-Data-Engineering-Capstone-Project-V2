## Module Breakdown:

[**Module 1:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/1_MySQL_OLTP_DB_Transactional_Data)
- Focuses on designing and populating the MySQL OLTP database for real-time transactional processing.
- Automates data exports to the data warehouse, using **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate scheduled exports for continuous data integration. **Apache Kafka** could be used here for real-time streaming of transactional events from MySQL to downstream systems, ensuring low-latency data availability.

[**Module 2:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/2_MongoDB_NoSQL_Database_Catalog_Data)
- Establishes the MongoDB NoSQL database for catalog data, setting up the foundation for storing product details in a scalable, flexible format.
- This module emphasizes managing and querying unstructured catalog data, with **Apache Kafka** optionally streaming catalog changes (e.g., updates to product data) from MongoDB to the data warehouse in real time.

**Module 3:** Divided into two parts:

- [**Module 3-a:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/3-a%20_PostgreSQL_Staging_Data_Warehouse)
    - Schema design for the data warehouse, integrating OLTP and NoSQL schemas. This design step considers both relational and non-relational data structures for efficient reporting.

- [**Module 3-b:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/3-b_Db2_Production_Data_Warehouse)
    - Implements the data warehouse schema by creating fact and dimension tables
    - Sets up automated data ingestion, with **Apache Airflow** managing ETL processes and scheduling daily batch loads into the data warehouse. Create Cubes and Rollups to make the reporting easier. **Kafka** could stream real-time incremental data from the OLTP and NoSQL databases, enabling near real-time data warehousing.

[**Module 4:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/4_Cognos_Analytics_Business_Intelligence)
- Involves creating a business intelligence data source in Cognos, setting up charts and reports for sales metrics.
- This module focuses on visual analytics and historical data interpretation for 2020, leveraging the data in the warehouse ingested through **Airflow** and, potentially, real-time insights from **Kafka** streams.

[**Module 5:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/5_ETL_and_Data_Pipelines)
- Builds an ETL pipeline using **Apache Airflow** to pull data from MySQL, MongoDB, and OLTP databases, transforming it to fit the data warehouse schema.
- **Kafka** can support real-time or near real-time data extraction from source systems, continuously streaming data to ensure minimal lag in data availability for ETL.

[**Module 6:**](Capstone%20Project%20Files/6_Spark_BigData_Cluster)
- Applies Sparkâ€™s machine learning library (SparkML) to build a model for sales projections, leveraging Big Data analytics to derive insights and support decision-making.
