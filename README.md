- **Role:** Stores processed data in a structured format, optimized for high-performance queries and BI reporting.
- **Benefits:** Serverless, fully managed, and highly scalable with advanced capabilities like time travel and zero-copy cloning.

### 4. ETL Processing (AWS Glue)
- **Purpose:** Serverless ETL pipeline for data transformation from raw S3 storage into Snowflake.
- **Role:** Runs scheduled batch jobs to transform and load data from the data lake (S3) into the data warehouse (Snowflake).
- **Benefits:** Fully managed, auto-scaling, and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services.

### 5. Big Data Processing & Machine Learning (Databricks)
- **Purpose:** Data processing and machine learning pipeline built on Apache Spark.
- **Role:** Processes data, executes machine learning workflows, and integrates with Snowflake for complex analytical queries.
- **Benefits:** Collaborative environment for data scientists and data engineers, with managed MLflow for model versioning, tracking, and deployment.

### 6. Business Intelligence (Looker)
- **Purpose:** Data visualization and BI reporting tool.
- **Role:** Connects to Snowflake to create dashboards and reports, enabling interactive data exploration and insights generation.
- **Benefits:** Supports self-service analytics, with customizable dashboards and reports.

### 7. Real-Time Model Deployment (Databricks MLflow)
- **Purpose:** Enables model deployment and monitoring.
- **Role:** Deploys predictive models trained on Databricks into a production environment, allowing for real-time predictions.
- **Benefits:** Integrates with Databricks for end-to-end model lifecycle management, including tracking and monitoring.
